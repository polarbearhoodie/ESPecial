# esper
This project is a collection of files, designed to make building with the ESP32-C6 a little easier.

### color.h
color.h is a wrapper for led_strip.h, and makes it easier to make color gradients, as well as led transitions. It can be optimized more, but it works consistently.

# TODO
The following have not yet been tested or released to this repo.

### wifi.h
wifi.h allows basic access to wifi, as well as some prebuilt functions to grab and send data or notifications based off the cpp-httplib. 

### display.h
display.h wraps the basic LLVM to control the standard 128*64 OLED display with minimal configuration.
